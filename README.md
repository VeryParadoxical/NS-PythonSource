# NS-PythonSource
This contains the source files for a networks and security assignment I completed at University in Python using JetBrains PyCharm as the IDE. This received a mark of 90%. 
Open the base folder in JetBrains PyCharm. This project uses python version 3.7. Source files can be accessed via:  source_project -> AssignmentProject -> venv

This project is intended to be an SMTP server following RFC821.
You can see the included guide to testing word file for information on how to test the program. Currently it only runs on local host and as such you should use PyCharm to run the SMTP Server and then the STMPClient so they can connect to eachother.
